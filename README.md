## 🛠️ Built With

- **React** (framework preset via Lovable)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling enforced by the platform)
- **React Router** (client-side routing)
- **Web3-style wallet connection (mock)** for cryptocurrency-based pet food purchases
- **3D/interactive visuals** (inspired design language from Huly.io and Igloo-style navigation)

## 🤸‍♂️ What It Does

You get a virtual pet in-browser that you can interact with. Beyond mere clicks, you can “buy” supplements (pet food) using a crypto-style flow by connecting a wallet. The wallet shows mock balances (e.g., `12 BTC` or `1255 ETH`), and purchases animate a fake transaction to feed your pet.

## 💡 Supplements Page (The Extra, Unasked-For Feature)

A dedicated **Supplements** page where you can purchase virtual pet food using cryptocurrency:

- 3D interactive food items represent different supplements.
- Users connect their wallet (either via manual address input or simulated Web3 connect).
- Displays mock balances: `12 BTC` or `1255 ETH` depending on wallet type.
- Purchase flow with confirmation modal and animated fake transaction success.
- Designed in the same clean, minimal, interactive UI style (Huly.io + Igloo influence).
