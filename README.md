Project Description

An interactive website where you can adopt and interact with a virtual pet — feed it, connect your wallet for supplements, and just vibe in a clean 3D-inspired UI.

? The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

Too many people go through life without having a virtual emoji pet that does absolutely nothing useful. A modern tragedy.

## 🪄 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

We built a web-based emoji pet that you can feed with imaginary crypto and emotionally pretend to bond with. Real pets poop. Ours just blinks.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **React** (Lovable's framework preset)
* **Tailwind CSS** (enforced styling)
* **React Router** (for navigation)
* **Web3-style mock wallet connect**
* **3D / interactive visuals** inspired by [Huly.io](https://huly.io) and [Igloo](https://www.igloo.inc)

## 🤸‍♂️ What It Does

You get to interact with a cute virtual pet inside your browser. It's a joyful, browser-based companion you can feed, click, or ignore endlessly. It's not productive — and that’s exactly the point.

## 💡 Supplements Page (That Nobody Asked For)

We added a completely extra feature — a **Supplements Page** — where you can:

* View animated 3D food items
* “Buy” pet food using a **mock crypto wallet**
* Choose from `12 BTC` or `1255 ETH` balance displays
* Simulate a transaction with a fun confirmation flow
* Feed your pet and feel proud (for no reason)

Styled with floating UI cards, animated visuals, and Igloo-style page transitions — because why not?

## 🧰 How to Use / Deploy

### Local Preview

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Navigate to any route (like `/`, `/supplements`)

### Vercel Deployment Setup

For React Router to work properly on Vercel, create a `vercel.json` file in the project root:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Vercel Settings**:

* Framework Preset: `React`
* Build Command: `npm run build`
* Output Directory: `build`
